Email Notifier is a stand-alone email service that consumes messages from kafka topic, produced by the central-event-processor service.  
The central-event-processor repo is available [here](https://github.com/mojaloop/central-event-processor/tree/master)  
The email-notifier flow is available [here](https://github.com/mojaloop/central-event-processor/tree/master#Notifierflowseparateservice)

## Todo

- Improve code-coverage to 90% across the board: [.nycrc.yml](./.nycrc.yml). Don't forget to un-comment out the branches code-coverage rule.

## Config

Refer to [`./config/default.json`](config/default.json) for a detailed look at the configuration options.

For configuring email:

```json
  "emailSettings": {
    "smtpConfig": {
      "host": "smtp.gmail.com",
      "port": 587,
      "secureConnection": false,
      "tls": {
        "ciphers":"SSLv3"
     },
      "auth": {
        "user": "modusboxnotifier@gmail.com",
        "pass": "m0dusb0xn0t1f13r"
      }
    }
  }
```

Those can be passed as the following environment variables: 

```json
{
  "emailSettings": {
    "smtpConfig": {
      "host": "MAIL_NOTIF_SMTP_HOST",
      "port": "MAIL_NOTIF_SMTP_PORT",
      "secureConnection": "MAIL_NOTIF_SMTP_SECURE_FLAG",
      "tls": {
        "ciphers":"MAIL_NOTIF_SMTP_TLS_CIPHERS"
     },
      "auth": {
        "user": "MAIL_NOTIF_SMTP_USER",
        "pass": "MAIL_NOTIF_SMTP_PASS"
      }
    }
  }
}  
```

## Troubleshooting `npm install` on MacOS

If you have this or similar error during installation:

```bash
npm install
> node-gyp rebuild
clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1
```

add the following environment variables: 
```bash
export CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include
export LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib
```


## Auditing Dependencies

We use `npm-audit-resolver` along with `npm audit` to check dependencies for node vulnerabilities, and keep track of resolved dependencies with an `audit-resolve.json` file.

To start a new resolution process, run:
```bash
npm run audit:resolve
```

You can then check to see if the CI will pass based on the current dependencies with:
```bash
npm run audit:check
```

And commit the changed `audit-resolv.json` to ensure that CircleCI will build correctly.

## Container Scans

As part of our CI/CD process, we use anchore-cli to scan our built docker container for vulnerabilities upon release.

If you find your release builds are failing, refer to the [container scanning](https://github.com/mojaloop/ci-config#container-scanning) in our shared Mojaloop CI config repo. There is a good chance you simply need to update the `mojaloop-policy-generator.js` file and re-run the circleci workflow.
